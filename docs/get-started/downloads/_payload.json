Important !)*** Rearranged memory layout. Refer to [the documentation page](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Architecture/Memory%20Layout.html#memory-layout-v100-alpha-) for memory to learn about the change, and how to adapt your code to fit.\r\n* Update console UI\r\n* Add `-v` `--verbose` option to toggle printing more in-depth compilation and assembly text\r\n* Add `-nk` `--nokeyboard` option to toggle between mouse input mode and keyboard input mode\r\n* Add `-f` `--freq` option to override the default target CPU emulation frequency\r\n* Improve `.AEXE` file format for better automatic detection as file input\r\n* Fixed bug related to executing emulator in directory without a char_set_memtape file\r\n* Add feature for simple 3 channel single-tone audio when using keyboard mode\r\n* Add icon for executable\r\n* Replace normal Windows binary with an installer for easier use and adding to the user's PATH variable, which allows for console use from any directory.\r\n* Shorten name from
