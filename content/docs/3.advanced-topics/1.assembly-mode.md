description: Learn how to write raw assembly code in Yabal.

# Assembly mode
Yabal has a special mode called "assembly mode". In assembly mode, you can write assembly code directly in your program.

To enter assembly mode, use the `asm` keyword, followed by a block of code surrounded by curly braces (`{` and `}`):
```yabal
asm {
    // Assembly code goes here
}
```

Assembly mode is useful if you want to use an instruction that is not supported by Yabal, or if you want to optimize a piece of code.

## Comments
The default comment style in assembly mode is the same as in Yabal (`//` for single-line comments and `/*` and `*/` for multi-line comments) but you can also use assembly comments.

Assembly comments start with `,` and end at the end of the line:
```yabal
asm {
    , This is an assembly comment
}
```
These comments are are included in the generated assembly code, which can be useful for adding notes to the assembly code.

## Instructions
To see the list of supported assembly instructions, see the [Astro-8 instruction set documentation](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Architecture/Instruction%20Set.html).

In addition to the instructions listed in the instruction set documentation, Yabal also supports the following instructions:

| Instruction | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `JE` | Jump to the specified label if register `A` is equal to register `B` |
| `JNE` | Jump to the specified label if register `A` is not equal to register `B` |
| `JL` | Jump to the specified label if register `A` is less than register `B` |
| `JLE` | Jump to the specified label if register `A` is less than or equal to register `B` |
| `JG` | Jump to the specified label if register `A` is greater than register `B` |
| `JGE` | Jump to the specified label if register `A` is greater than or equal to register `B` |

### Labels
Labels are used to mark a location in the assembly code. They are used by jump instructions to jump to a specific location in the code.

Labels are declared by writing the name of the label, followed by a colon (`:`):
```yabal
asm {
    label:
}
```

To jump to a label, use the `JMP` instruction:
```yabal
asm {
    label:
    JMP label
}
```

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Note:</strong> It is only possible to jump to labels that are declared in the same assembly block.
</div>

## Variable addresses
In assembly mode, you can get the address of a variable by using `@` followed by the name of the variable:

```yabal
int a = 1

asm {
    AIN @a // Read the value of a into register A
    LDIB 1 // Load the value 1 into register B
    ADD // Add the value of register B to register A
    STA @a // Store the value of register A into a
}
```
