# Basics of Yabal
This page will teach you the basics of Yabal.

## Comments
Comments are used to add notes to your code. They are ignored by the compiler.

There are two types of comments in Yabal: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments start with `//` and end at the end of the line:
```yabal
// This is a single-line comment
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`:
```yabal
/*
This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

## Types
Yabal is a statically typed language. An statically typed language means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. This is in contrast to a dynamically typed language (like JavaScript), where the type of a variable is only known at runtime.

Yabal has the following types:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `int` | A 16-bit unsigned integer |
| `bool` | A boolean value (`true` or `false`) stored as a 16-bit integer |
| *type*`[]` | An [array](#arrays) of values of the specified type |
| *UserDefined* | An user-defined [struct](#structs) |

### Structs
A struct is a user-defined type. It contains a number of fields, which can be of any [type](#types).

Structs are declared using the `struct` keyword, followed by the name of the struct, and then a block of code surrounded by curly braces (`{` and `}`).
Within the block of code, you can declare fields by specifying the [type](#types) and name of the field.

For example, we declare a struct called `Position` with two fields, `x` and `y`:
```yabal
struct Position {
    int x
    int y
}
```

### Arrays
An array is a collection of values of the same type. Arrays are declared using the `[]` operator:
```yabal
int[] numbers // An array of integers
```

## Statements
The actual code in a Yabal program is made up of statements. Common statements are variable declarations, declaring functions, calling functions and control flow statements.

A statement can be a single line of code that ends with a new-line or [semi-colon](#semi-colons). A statement can also be multiple lines of code surrounded by curly braces (`{` and `}`).

The following code shows an example of a block of code:
```yabal {}[run]
// Variable declaration statement
int variable

// Assignment statement
variable = 0

// If statement that contains multiple statements
if (variable == 0) {
    // Assignment statement
    variable = 1

    // Expression statement (postfix increment)
    variable++
}
```

## Expressions
An expression is a statement that evaluates to a value. For example, `1 + 2` is an expression that evaluates to `3`.

Expressions can be used in many places, such as in assignment statements, function calls, and control flow statements.

## Variables
Variables are used to store values in memory.

You can declare variable specifying the [type](#types) and name of the variable:
```yabal
// Create an integer variable called "variable"
int variable
```

You can also assign a value to a variable when declaring it by using the `=` operator:
```yabal
// Create an integer variable called "variable" and assign it the value 1
int variable = 1
```

It is also possible to let the compiler infer the type of the variable. This is done by using the `var` keyword.
The compiler will look at the value that is assigned to the variable, and infer the type from that:
```yabal
// Create an integer variable called "variable" and assign it the value 1
var variable = 1
```

## Semi-colons
Semi-colons can be used to separate statements. They are optional, but are required if you want to put multiple statements on the same line.

For example, this is valid:
```yabal
int a = 1
```

But this is not, since there are multiple statements on the same line:
```yabal
int a = 1 int b = 2
```

If you want to put multiple statements on the same line, you can use semi-colons to separate them:
```yabal
int a = 1; int b = 2
```

## Functions
Functions are used to reuse code. When you declare a function with code, you can call it from other places in your code.

Functions are specified the return [type](#types) and name of the function, followed by the parameters of the function in parentheses (`(` and `)`), and then a block of code surrounded by curly braces (`{` and `}`).

To return a value from a function, use the `return` keyword followed by the value to return.

For example, the following code declares a function called `add` that takes two integers as parameters and returns an integer:
```yabal
// Declare the add function
// The function takes two integers (a and b) as parameters and returns an integer
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b
}
```

Functions can also be declared without a return type by specifying `void` as the return type. A function with a return type of `void` cannot return a value.

For example, the following code declares a function called `print` that takes a int array as a parameter and returns nothing:
```yabal
void print(int[] data) {
    // Print the value to the screen
}
```


### Calling functions
To call a function, use the name of the function followed by the arguments of the function in parentheses (`(` and `)`).

For example, the following code calls the `add` function that we declared earlier:
```yabal {2}[run]
// Call the add function and store the result in the "result" variable
int result = add(1, 2)

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b
}
```
