# Emulator
To run your Yabal programs, you need to install the Astro-8 emulator. The Astro-8 emulator is a virtual machine that runs Astro-8 assembly code. Yabal compiles your code to Astro-8 assembly code, which is then run by the emulator.

## Native emulator
It is recommended to install the [Astro-8 emulator](https://github.com/sam-astro/Astro8-Computer/releases) by [sam-astro](https://github.com/sam-astro) to run your programs, since the emulator contains all the latest features like audio and file system support.

To start your script with the native Astro-8 emulator, add the `-n` flag in the run command:
```bash
yabal run program.yabal -n
```

If you want to pass arguments to the native emulator, add `--` and move the file name to the end of the command. After that, you can pass arguments to the emulator:
```bash
yabal run -n -- program.yabal -f 1000
```
For all the options of the native emulator, [see the documentation](https://sam-astro.github.io/Astro8-Computer/docs/Usage.html#emulator).

## Built-in emulator
If you don't want to install the Astro-8 emulator, you can use the built-in emulator instead. However, the built-in emulator is not as feature-rich as the native emulator.

To start your program with the built-in emulator, run the following command:
```bash
yabal run program.yabal
```
