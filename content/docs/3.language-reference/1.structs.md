# Structs
A struct is a data structure that can contain multiple fields. A struct can be used to group related data together. For example, the following struct can be used to represent a 2D point:

```yabal
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
}
```

## Bit-fields
It is also possible to declare a field with a bit-width. This is useful if you want to read data from a hardware device, such as a mouse. For example, the following struct can be used to read the position of a mouse, and the state of its left and right buttons:
```yabal
struct MouseInput {
    int y : 7;
    int x : 7;
    int left : 1;
    int right : 1;
}
```

::warning
**Note:** When declaring a field with a bit-width, the compiler will automatically add bit-wise operations to get and set the value of the field. This means that the field will be slower to access than a normal field.<br />
It is not recommended to use bit-fields unless you are reading data from a hardware device.

### Bit offsets
Bit-fields are aligned by 16 bits. It is not possible to start a bit-field outside the 16 bit range. For example:
```yabal
// Note: the following example will not compile
struct InvalidExample {
    int a : 7 // This is valid, offset 0 with 7 bits
    int b : 7 // This is valid, offset 7 with 7 bits
    int c : 7 // This is invalid, offset 14 with 7 bits: 14 + 7 > 16
}
```

When a normal field is introduced, the bit-field offset is reset to the 16 bit boundary. For example:
```yabal
struct Example {
    int a : 7   //          Offset 0,    7 bits
    int b : 7   //          Offset 7,    7 bits
    int c       // Reset,   Offset 16,   16 bits
    int d : 7   //          Offset 32,   7 bits
}
```
